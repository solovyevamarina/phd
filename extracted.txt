Any gross premium in excess of the net premium is deferred and recorded as a deferred profit liability, which is subsequently amortized in net earned premiums such that profits are recognized in a constant relationship with insurance in force.

The preparation and evaluation of these critical accounting estimates involve the use of various assumptions developed from management’s analyses and judgments.
