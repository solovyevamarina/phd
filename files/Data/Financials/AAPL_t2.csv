for arrangements with multiple performance obligations which represent promises within an arrangement that are capable of being distinct the company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices -“ssp”. when available the company uses observable prices to determine the ssp. when observable prices are not available ssps are established that reflect the company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. the company’s process for estimating ssps without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including where applicable prices charged by the company for similar offerings market trends in the pricing for similar offerings product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation. apple inc. | q3 2019 form 10-q |,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7.0,,

is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. the company’s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including but not limited to those set forth in part ii item 1a of this form 10-q under the heading “risk factors” and those described in this paragraph. in general the company believes gross margins will be subject to volatility and remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; potential increases in the cost of components outside manufacturing services and acquiring and delivering content for the company’s services; the company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services or in the geographic currency or channel mix; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; and costs associated with the company’s frequent introductions and transitions of products and services. apple inc. | q3 2019 form 10-q |,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,28.0,,

due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. the success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful development market acceptance the company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product and service introductions and transitions. apple inc. | q3 2019 form 10-q |,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,36.0,,
the company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected for any number of reasons including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company’s requirements. if the company’s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the company the company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. the company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. apple inc. | q3 2019 form 10-q |,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,37.0,,
some third-party digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. if requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. in addition certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the company’s content providers. apple inc. | q3 2019 form 10-q |,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,38.0,,
regardless of the merit of particular claims litigation may be expensive time consuming disruptive to the company’s operations and distracting to management. in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into licensing agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes. no assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. these agreements may also significantly increase the company’s cost of sales and operating expenses. apple inc. | q3 2019 form 10-q |,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,39.0,,

international trade disputes could result in tariffs and other protectionist measures that could adversely affect the company’s business. tariffs could increase the cost of the company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. these increased costs could adversely impact the gross margin that the company earns on its products. tariffs could also make the company’s products more expensive for customers which could make the company’s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. countries may also adopt other protectionist measures that could limit the company’s ability to offer its products and services. political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes and protectionist measures could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending which could adversely affect the company’s business. apple inc. | q3 2019 form 10-q |,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,42.0,,
weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar adversely affects the u.s. dollar value of the company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings and generally leads the company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the company’s products. in some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the u.s. dollar’s strengthening which would adversely affect the u.s. dollar value of the gross margins the company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales. apple inc. | q3 2019 form 10-q |,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,43.0,,
the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the u.s. internal revenue service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. if the company’s effective tax rates were to increase particularly in the u.s. or ireland or if the ultimate determination of the company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued the company’s financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. apple inc. | q3 2019 form 10-q |,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,44.0,,

for arrangements with multiple performance obligations which represent promises within an arrangement that are capable of being distinct the company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices -“ssp”. when available the company uses observable prices to determine the ssp. when observable prices are not available ssps are established that reflect the company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. the company’s process for estimating ssps without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including where applicable prices charged by the company for similar offerings market trends in the pricing for similar offerings product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation. apple inc. | q2 2019 form 10-q |,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7.0,

is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. the company’s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including but not limited to those set forth in part ii item 1a of this form 10-q under the heading “risk factors” and those described in this paragraph. in general the company believes gross margins will be subject to volatility and remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; potential increases in the cost of components outside manufacturing services and acquiring and delivering content for the company’s services; the company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services or in the geographic currency or channel mix; fluctuations in exchange rates; and costs associated with the company’s frequent introductions and transitions of products and services. apple inc. | q2 2019 form 10-q |,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,28.0,

a downturn in the economic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the company’s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the company’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the company’s financial instruments. these and other economic factors could materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations financial condition and growth. apple inc. | q2 2019 form 10-q |,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,35.0,
due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. the success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful development market acceptance the company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product and service introductions and transitions. apple inc. | q2 2019 form 10-q |,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,36.0,
the company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected for any number of reasons including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company’s requirements. if the company’s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the company the company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. the company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. apple inc. | q2 2019 form 10-q |,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,37.0,
some third-party digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. if requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. in addition certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the company’s content providers. apple inc. | q2 2019 form 10-q |,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,38.0,
regardless of the merit of particular claims litigation may be expensive time consuming disruptive to the company’s operations and distracting to management. in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into licensing agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes. no assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. these agreements may also significantly increase the company’s cost of sales and operating expenses. apple inc. | q2 2019 form 10-q |,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,39.0,
the company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including but not limited to economic and labor conditions increased duties taxes and other costs political instability and international trade disputes. gross margins on the company’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping penalties. the company is also exposed to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets. there can be no assurance the company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. apple inc. | q2 2019 form 10-q |,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,40.0,

international trade disputes could result in tariffs and other protectionist measures that could adversely affect the company’s business. tariffs could increase the cost of the company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. these increased costs could adversely impact the gross margin that the company earns on its products. tariffs could also make the company’s products more expensive for customers which could make the company’s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. countries may also adopt other protectionist measures that could limit the company’s ability to offer its products and services. political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes and protectionist measures could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending which could adversely affect the company’s business. apple inc. | q2 2019 form 10-q |,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,42.0,
weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar adversely affects the u.s. dollar value of the company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings and generally leads the company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the company’s products. in some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the u.s. dollar’s strengthening which would adversely affect the u.s. dollar value of the gross margins the company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales. apple inc. | q2 2019 form 10-q |,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,43.0,
the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the u.s. internal revenue service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. if the company’s effective tax rates were to increase particularly in the u.s. or ireland or if the ultimate determination of the company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued the company’s financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. apple inc. | q2 2019 form 10-q |,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,44.0,
