for any available-for-sale securities with significant declines in fair value the company performs detailed analyses to identify whether the drivers of the declines are due to general market drivers such as the recent rise in interest rates or due to credit-related factors. identifying the drivers of the declines in fair value helps to align and allocate the company‘s resources to securities with real credit-related concerns that could impact ultimate collection of principal and interest. for any significant declines in fair value determined to be non-interest rate or market related the company performs a more focused review of the related issuers' specific credit profile. for corporate issuers the company evaluates their assets business profile including industry dynamics and competitive positioning financial statements and other available financial data. for non-corporate issuers the company analyzes all sources of credit support including issuer-specific factors. the company utilizes information available in the public domain and for certain private placement issuers from consultations with the issuers directly. the company also considers ratings from nationally recognized statistical rating organizations -nrsros as well as the specific characteristics of the security it owns including seniority in the issuer's capital structure covenant protections or other relevant features. from these reviews the company evaluates the issuers' continued ability to service the company's investment through payment of interest and principal.,16.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

in japan the government also requires the insurance industry to contribute to a policyholder protection corporation that provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent insurers; however these costs are calculated and administered differently than in the u.s.  in japan these costs are not directly related to specific insolvencies or bankruptcies but are rather a regular operational cost for an insurance company. based on this structure the company does not remove the japan policyholder protection expenses from adjusted earnings. the company considers the costs associated with the early redemption of its debt to be unrelated to the underlying fundamentals and trends in its insurance operations. additionally these costs are driven by changes in interest rates subsequent to the issuance of the debt and the company considers these interest rate changes to represent economic conditions not directly associated with its insurance operations.,76.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company its subsidiaries and those entities required to be consolidated under applicable accounting standards. all material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. in the opinion of management the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of the company contain all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals which are necessary to fairly present the consolidated balance sheets as of march 31 2023 and december 31 2022 and the consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income -loss shareholders' equity and cash flows for the three-month periods ended march 31 2023 and 2022. results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year. as a result these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the company's annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31 2022 -2022 annual report.,,,,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,
: certain direct and incremental costs of acquiring insurance contracts are deferred and amortized on a grouped-contract basis over the expected term of the related contracts using a constant-level basis. for life and health products issued in japan the constant-level basis used is units in force which is a proxy for face amount and insurance in force respectively. for life and health products issued in the u.s. the constant-level basis used is face amount and number of policies in force respectively. amortization is computed using the same contract groupings -also referred to as cohorts and mortality and termination assumptions that are used in computing the lfpb and these assumptions are reviewed and updated at least annually. the effects of changes in assumptions are recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term as a revision of the future amortization pattern while current period amortization is calculated based on the actual experience during the quarter. deferred costs include the excess of current-year commissions over ultimate renewal-year commissions and certain incremental direct policy issue underwriting and sales expenses directly related to successful policy acquisition.,,,,7.0,,,,,,,,,,,
discount rates used to calculate net premiums are locked in at policy inception and represent the basis to recognize interest expense in the consolidated statement of earnings. discount rates used to measure the carrying value of the lfpb in the consolidated balance sheet are updated each reporting period and the difference between the liability balances calculated using the locked-in discount rates and the updated discount rates is recognized in other comprehensive income -loss -oci. the company has designed its discount rate methodology for the u.s. and japan insurance business. the methodology incorporates constructing a discount rate curve separately for discounting cash flows used to calculate the u.s. and japan lfpbs reflective of the characteristics of the insurance liabilities such as currency and tenor. discount rates comprising each curve are determined by reference to upper-medium grade -low credit risk fixed-income instrument yields that,,,,8.0,,,,,,,,,,,

for any of its fixed maturity securities with significant declines in fair value the company performs detailed analyses to identify whether the drivers of the declines are due to general market drivers such as the recent rise in interest rates or due to credit-related factors. identifying the drivers of the declines in fair value helps to align and allocate the company‘s resources to securities with real credit-related concerns that could impact ultimate collection of principal and interest. for any significant declines in fair value determined to be non-interest rate or market related the company performs a more focused review of the related issuers' specific credit profile. for corporate issuers the company evaluates their assets business profile including industry dynamics and competitive positioning financial statements and other available financial data. for non-corporate issuers the company analyzes all sources of credit support including issuer-specific factors. the company utilizes information available in the public domain and for certain private placement issuers from consultations with the issuers directly. the company also considers ratings from nationally recognized statistical rating organizations -nrsros as well as the specific,,,,23.0,,,,,,,,,,,

securities lending and pledged securities the company lends fixed maturity and public equity securities to financial institutions in short-term security-lending transactions. these short-term security-lending arrangements increase investment income with minimal risk. the company receives cash or other securities as collateral for such loans. the company's security lending policy requires that the fair value of the securities received as collateral be 102% or more of the fair value of the loaned securities and that unrestricted cash received as collateral be 100% or more of the fair value of the loaned securities. the securities loaned continue to be carried as investment assets on the company's balance sheet during the terms of the loans and are not reported as sales. for loans involving unrestricted cash or securities as collateral the collateral is reported as an asset with a corresponding liability for the return of the collateral. for loans where the company receives as collateral securities that the company is not permitted to sell or repledge the collateral is not reflected on the consolidated financial statements.,,,,30.0,,,,,,,,,,,

bond purchase commitments at the inception of investments in consolidated vies. some of the company's derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges fair value hedges or net investment hedges; however other derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting or the company elects not to designate them as accounting hedges.,,,,31.0,,,,,,,,,,,
swaptions are used to mitigate the adverse impact resulting from significant changes in the fair value of u.s. dollar-denominated available-for-sale securities due to fluctuation in interest rates. in a payer swaption the company pays a premium to obtain the right but not the obligation to enter into a swap contract where it will pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate. interest rate swaption collars are combinations of two swaption positions. in order to maximize the efficiency of the collars while minimizing cost a collar strategy is used whereby the company purchases a long payer swaption -the company purchases an option that allows it to enter into a swap where the company will pay the fixed rate and receive the floating rate of the swap and sells a short receiver swaption -the company sells an option that provides the counterparty with the right to enter into a swap where the company will receive the fixed rate and pay the floating rate of the swap. the combination of purchasing the long payer swaption and selling the short receiver swaption results in no net premium being paid -ie. a costless or zero-cost collar. bond purchase commitments result from repackaged bond structures that are consolidated vies whereby there is a delay in the trade date and settlement date of the bond within the structure to ensure completion of all necessary legal agreements to support the consolidated vie that issues the repackaged bond. since the company has a commitment to purchase the underlying bond at a specified price the agreement meets the definition of a derivative where the value is derived based on the current market value of the bond compared to the fixed purchase price to be paid on the settlement date.,,,,32.0,,,,,,,,,,,

foreign currency forwards and options hedge the foreign currency exposure of certain u.s. dollar-denominated available-for-sale fixed-maturity investments held in aflac japan. the change in the fair value of the foreign currency forwards related to the changes in the difference between the spot rate and the forward price is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. the change in fair value of the foreign currency option related to the time value of the option is recognized in current earnings and is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. interest rate swaptions hedge the interest rate exposure of certain u.s. dollar-denominated available-for-sale securities held in aflac japan. for these hedging relationships the company excludes time value from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes changes in the intrinsic value of the swaptions in current earnings within net investment income. the change in the time value of the swaptions is recognized in other comprehensive income -loss and amortized into earnings -net investment income over its legal term.,,,,33.0,,,,,,,,,,,

the company's investment in aflac japan is affected by changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate. to mitigate this exposure the parent company's yen-denominated liabilities -see note 9 have been designated as non-derivative hedges and certain foreign currency forwards and options have been designated as derivative hedges of the foreign currency exposure of the company's net investment in aflac japan. the company's net investment hedge was effective during the three-month periods ended march 31 2023 and 2022 respectively.,,,,34.0,,,,,,,,,,,
the company uses foreign exchange forwards and options to economically mitigate the currency risk of some of its u.s. dollar-denominated loan receivables held within the aflac japan segment. these arrangements are not designated as accounting hedges as the foreign currency remeasurement of the loan receivables impacts current period earnings and substantially offsets gains and losses from foreign exchange forwards within net investment gains -losses. the company also has certain foreign exchange forwards on u.s. dollar-denominated available-for-sale securities where hedge accounting is not being applied. the company uses interest rate swaps to economically convert the variable rate investment income to a fixed rate on certain variable-rate investments.,,,,35.0,,,,,,,,,,,

gains and losses on cash flow hedges and the change in the fair value of interest rate swaptions related to the time value of the swaptions in fair value hedges are recorded as unrealized gains -losses. gains and losses on net investment hedges related to changes in foreign currency spot rates are recorded in the unrealized foreign currency translation gains -losses line in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income -loss.,,,,-3.0,,,,,,,,,,,
for the foreign currency swaps associated with the company's vie investments for which it is the primary beneficiary the company bears the risk of loss due to counterparty default even though it is not a direct counterparty to those contracts. the company is a direct counterparty to the foreign currency swaps that it has entered into in connection with certain of its senior notes and subordinated debentures; foreign currency forwards; and foreign currency options and therefore the company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties in those contracts. the risk of counterparty default for the company's foreign currency swaps certain foreign currency forwards and foreign currency options is mitigated by collateral posting requirements that counterparties to those transactions must meet.,,,,36.0,,,,,,,,,,,
the company has securities lending agreements with unaffiliated financial institutions that post collateral to the company in return for the use of its fixed maturity and public equity securities -see note 3. when the company has entered into securities lending agreements with the same counterparty the agreements generally provide for net settlement in the event of default by the counterparty. this right of set-off allows the company to keep and apply collateral received if the counterparty failed to return the securities borrowed from the company as contractually agreed. the tables below summarize the company's derivatives and securities lending transactions and as reflected in the tables in accordance with u.s. gaap the company's policy is to not offset these financial instruments in the consolidated balance sheets.,,,,37.0,,,,,,,,,,,

u.s. gaap specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. these two types of inputs create three valuation hierarchy levels. level 1 valuations reflect quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. level 2 valuations reflect quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market quoted market prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets or model-derived valuations in which all significant valuation inputs are observable in active markets. level 3 valuations reflect valuations in which one or more of the significant inputs are not observable in an active market. the following tables present the fair value hierarchy levels of the company's assets and liabilities that are measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis.,,,,41.0,,,,,,,,,,,

in the aflac japan segment all long-duration insurance policies are denominated in yen. a significant portion of policies are characterized by tenors exceeding the availability of liquid market data in japan for single-a rated -as a proxy for upper-medium grade corporate yen-denominated debt. the discount rate curve is designed to prioritize the observable inputs where available while past the last liquid point the data is derived based on estimation techniques consistent with the fair value guidance in asc 820. the aflac japan segment curve utilizes liquid market indices tracking publicly traded yen-denominated single-a corporate debt for the initial 10-year tenor. for the bonds within these market indices where only local ratings are available the company prioritizes the bonds with local ratings that are equivalent to a single-a rating based on international rating standards. for the discount rates applicable to tenors for which the japan single-a debt market is not liquid but there is sufficient observable market data and/or the observable market data is available for similar instruments -between 10 and 30 years the company estimates tenor-specific single-a credit spreads and applies them to risk-free government rates. lastly for the tenors where there is limited or no observable single-a or similar market data or risk-free government rates -beyond 30 years the discount curve is derived by extrapolation of risk free rates beyond their last liquid point following the smith-wilson method and grading of the estimated forward credit spread anchored by the ultimate forward rate. the ultimate forward rate is based on the economic value-based solvency regime which is consistent with the international association of insurance supervisors -iais insurance capital standards -ics -which is expected to be introduced in japan in 2025  and is adjusted for credit and inflation components.,,,,60.0,,,,,,,,,,,

the company periodically enters into fixed quota-share coinsurance agreements in the normal course of business. for each of its reinsurance agreements the company determines whether the agreement provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk in accordance with applicable accounting standards. reinsurance premiums and benefits paid or provided are accounted for on bases consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts. premiums and benefits are reported net of insurance ceded. in january 2023 alij entered into a coinsurance transaction whereby it ceded 28% of the liabilities associated with certain cancer insurance policies and riders to aflac re. this transaction transferred approximately $2.1 billion of reserves associated with these policies. approximately $1.9 billion of assets were transferred from alij to aflac re as preliminary consideration for assuming the reinsurance risk and final settlement is expected in the second quarter of 2023. this internal reinsurance transaction with aflac re has no financial statement impact on a consolidated basis except for the effect of foreign currency accounting.,,,,64.0,,,,,,,,,,,

in japan the government also requires the insurance industry to contribute to a policyholder protection corporation that provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent insurers; however these costs are calculated and administered differently than in the u.s.  in japan these costs are not directly related to specific insolvencies or bankruptcies but are rather a regular operational cost for an insurance company. based on this structure the company does not remove the japan policyholder protection expenses from adjusted earnings. the company considers the costs associated with the early redemption of its debt to be unrelated to the underlying fundamentals and trends in its insurance operations. additionally these costs are driven by changes in interest rates subsequent to the issuance of the debt and the company considers these interest rate changes to represent economic conditions not directly associated with its insurance operations.,,,,81.0,,,,,,,,,,,

market conditions: the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 -covid-19 global pandemic on the company continues to evolve and the continued path of the global economic recovery remains uncertain given the potential longer term impacts of the pandemic. for example economic conditions have acted as headwinds to sales in the first nine months of 2022 particularly in japan and most notably in the first quarter with a gradually decreasing impact in the second and third quarters pressuring net earned premiums. further in the u.s. supply shortages upward pressure on wages to attract employees and higher commodity prices have all driven near-term increases in inflation. central bank,,,,,9.0,,,,,,,,,,
as part of working toward implementation of the updated standard the company has made key accounting policy decisions including processes to identify insurance policy groupings -cohorts for lfpb measurement and dac amortization purposes applicable discount rates development of liability cash flow and claim expense assumptions and dac amortization methodology. the company will not early adopt the updated standard and has selected the modified retrospective transition method which requires the amended guidance be applied as of the beginning of the earliest period presented beginning on the january 1 2021 transition date -transition date. the modified retrospective transition method generally results in applying the guidance to contracts on the basis of existing carrying values as of the transition date. on the transition date the company calculates the ratio of expected benefits less existing carrying values to gross premiums -net premium ratio using updated assumptions and the discount rate immediately before the transition date. for any cohorts that have a net premium ratio greater than 100% on the transition date the net premium ratio is capped at 100%. the company uses the net premium ratio calculated on the transition date -and capped at 100% if required to calculate the lfpb using two different discount rates: i the discount rate used immediately before the transition date and ii the discount rate determined by reference to the transition date market level yields for upper-medium-grade -low credit risk fixed income instruments -as of december 31 2020. for cohorts with their net premium ratio capped at 100% on the transition date any difference between the lfpb calculated using the discount rate immediately before the transition date and the existing carrying value as of the transition date is recorded as an adjustment -decrease to opening retained earnings. for all cohorts on the transition date the difference in the lfpb calculated using the two different discount rates -ie. the discount rate used immediately before the transition date and the updated discount rate as of the transition date is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income -aoci net of tax at transition.,,,,,10.0,,,,,,,,,,
• for dac amortization the company has elected to group insurance policies into cohorts that are consistent with the groupings used in estimating the associated lfpb. dac will be amortized on a constant-level basis for the grouped contracts over the expected remaining term of the related contracts. for both life and health products issued by aflac japan the constant-level basis used will be units in force which is a proxy for face amount and insurance in force respectively. for life products issued by aflac u.s. the constant level basis used will be face amount of policies in force; for health products issued by aflac u.s. the constant level basis used will be the number of policies in force.,,,,,11.0,,,,,,,,,,

for any of its fixed maturity securities with significant declines in fair value the company performs detailed analyses to identify whether the drivers of the declines are due to general market drivers such as the recent rise in interest rates or due to credit-related factors. identifying the drivers of the declines in fair value helps to align and allocate the company‘s resources to securities with real credit-related concerns that could impact ultimate collection of principal and interest. for any significant declines in fair value determined to be non-interest rate or market related the company performs a more focused review of the related issuers' specific credit profile. for corporate issuers the company evaluates their assets business profile including industry dynamics and competitive positioning financial statements and other available financial data. for non-corporate issuers the company analyzes all sources of credit support including issuer-specific factors. the company utilizes information available in the public domain and for certain private placement issuers from consultations with the issuers directly. the company also considers ratings from nationally recognized statistical rating organizations -nrsros as well as the specific characteristics of the security it owns including seniority in the issuer's capital structure covenant protections or other relevant features. from these reviews the company evaluates the issuers' continued ability to service the company's investment through payment of interest and principal.,,,,,24.0,,,,,,,,,,

the company calculates its allowance for credit losses for held-to-maturity fixed maturity securities loan receivables loan commitments and reinsurance recoverable by grouping assets with similar risk characteristics when there is not a specific expectation of a loss for an individual asset. for held-to-maturity fixed maturity securities mmls and mml commitments the company groups assets by credit ratings industry and country. the company groups cmls and tres and respective loan commitments by property type property location and the property’s ltv and debt service coverage ratios. the credit allowance for the reinsurance recoverable balance is estimated using a probability-of-default -pd / loss-given-default -lgd method. the credit allowance for held-to-maturity fixed maturity securities and loan receivables is estimated using a pd / lgd method discounted for the time value of money. for held-to-maturity fixed maturity securities available-for-sale fixed maturity securities and loan receivables the company includes the change in present value due to the passage of time in the change in the allowance for credit losses. the company’s methodology for estimating credit losses utilizes the contractual maturity date of the financial asset adjusted when necessary to reflect the expected timing of repayment -such as prepayment options renewal options call options or extension options. the company applies reasonable and,,,,,27.0,,,,,,,,,,

swaptions are used to mitigate the adverse impact resulting from significant changes in the fair value of u.s. dollar-denominated available-for-sale securities due to fluctuation in interest rates. in a payer swaption the company pays a premium to obtain the right but not the obligation to enter into a swap contract where it will pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate. interest rate swaption collars are combinations of two swaption positions. in order to maximize the efficiency of the collars while minimizing cost a collar strategy is used whereby the company purchases a long payer swaption -the company purchases an option that allows it to enter into a swap where the company will pay the fixed rate and receive the floating rate of the swap and sells a short receiver swaption -the company sells an option that provides the counterparty with the right to enter into a swap where the company will receive the fixed rate and pay the floating rate of the swap. the combination of purchasing the long payer swaption and selling the short receiver swaption results in no net premium being paid -ie. a costless or zero-cost collar. bond purchase commitments result from repackaged bond structures that are consolidated vies whereby there is a delay in the trade date and settlement date of the bond within the structure to ensure completion of all necessary legal agreements to support the consolidated vie that issues the repackaged bond. since the company has a commitment to purchase the underlying bond at a specified price the agreement meets the definition of a derivative where the value is derived based on the current market value of the bond compared to the fixed purchase price to be paid on the settlement date.,,,,,33.0,,,,,,,,,,

the company designates and accounts for certain foreign currency forwards options and interest rate swaptions as fair value hedges when they meet the requirements for hedge accounting. the company recognizes gains and losses on these derivatives as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the related hedged items in current earnings. foreign currency forwards and options hedge the foreign currency exposure of certain u.s. dollar-denominated available-for-sale fixed-maturity investments held in aflac japan. the change in the fair value of the foreign currency forwards related to the changes in the difference between the spot rate and the forward price is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. the change in fair value of the foreign currency option related to the time value of the option is recognized in current earnings and is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.,,,,,34.0,,,,,,,,,,

the company uses foreign exchange forwards and options to economically mitigate the currency risk of some of its u.s. dollar-denominated loan receivables held within the aflac japan segment. these arrangements are not designated as accounting hedges as the foreign currency remeasurement of the loan receivables impacts current period earnings and substantially offsets gains and losses from foreign exchange forwards within net investment gains -losses. the company also has certain foreign exchange forwards on u.s. dollar-denominated available-for-sale securities where hedge accounting is not being applied. the company uses interest rate swaps to economically convert the variable rate investment income to a fixed rate on certain variable-rate investments.,,,,,36.0,,,,,,,,,,

"the company has experienced continued favorable claim trends in 2022 for its core health products in japan. during the first nine months of 2022 there were impacts from lower utilization of healthcare services due to the covid-19 pandemic. this impacted both cancer and medical products as the japan population was avoiding doctor and hospital visits and staying home more. this resulted in lower sickness accident and cancer incurred claims. although overall experience is favorable during the first nine months of 2022 there has been an increase in medical hospitalization claims related to covid-19 mainly due to a wider scope of ""deemed hospitalization"" being utilized in japan. in addition dating back to before the pandemic cancer treatment patterns in japan are continuing to be influenced by significant advances in early-detection techniques and by the increased use of pathological diagnosis rather than clinical exams. additionally follow-up radiation and chemotherapy treatments are occurring more often on an outpatient basis. such changes in treatment not only increase the quality of life and initial outcomes for the patients but also decrease the average length of each hospital stay resulting in favorable claims development. in the first nine months of 2022 as experienced in 2021 and 2020 the incurred claims development related to prior years reflects favorable claims experience compared to previous estimates. the favorable claims trend continued for the majority of the company's major u.s. accident and health lines of business including accident hospital indemnity cancer critical illness and short-term disability. additionally refinements to covid-19 incurred estimates also contributed to the favorable development. the u.s. portion of the favorable claims development in the first nine months of 2022 includes $63 million related to refinements in the estimates for covid-19 and non-covid-19 claims as experience emerges.",,,,,59.0,,,,,,,,,,

due to the size of aflac japan where the functional currency is the japanese yen fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on reported results. in periods when the yen weakens translating yen into dollars results in fewer dollars being reported. when the yen strengthens translating yen into dollars results in more dollars being reported. consequently yen weakening has the effect of suppressing current period results in relation to the comparable prior period while yen strengthening has the effect of magnifying current period results in relation to the comparable prior period. a significant portion of the company’s business is conducted in yen and never converted into dollars but translated into dollars for u.s. gaap reporting purposes which results in foreign currency impact to earnings cash flows and book value on a u.s. gaap basis. management evaluates the company's financial performance both including and excluding the impact of foreign currency translation to monitor respectively cumulative currency impacts and the currency-neutral operating performance over time. the average yen/dollar exchange rate is based on the published mufg bank ltd. telegraphic transfer middle rate -ttm. the company defines the non-u.s. gaap financial measures included in this document as follows:,,,,,77.0,,,,,,,,,,

the u.s. insurance industry has a policyholder protection system that provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent insurers. the system can result in periodic charges to the company as a result of insolvencies/bankruptcies that occur with other companies in the life insurance industry. some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. these charges neither relate to the ordinary course of the company’s business nor reflect the company’s underlying business performance but result from external situations not controlled by the company. the company excludes any charges associated with u.s. guaranty fund assessments and the corresponding tax benefit or expense from adjusted earnings. in japan the government also requires the insurance industry to contribute to a policyholder protection corporation that provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent insurers; however these costs are calculated and administered differently than in the u.s.  in japan these costs are not directly related to specific insolvencies or bankruptcies but are rather a,,,,,80.0,,,,,,,,,,

for any of its fixed maturity securities with significant declines in fair value the company performs detailed analyses to identify whether the drivers of the declines are due to general market drivers such as the recent rise in interest rates or due to credit-related factors. identifying the drivers of the declines in fair value helps to align and allocate the company‘s resources to securities with real credit-related concerns that could impact ultimate collection of principal and interest. for any significant declines in fair value determined to be non-interest rate or market related the company performs a more focused review of the related issuers' specific credit profile. for corporate issuers the company evaluates their assets business profile including industry dynamics and competitive positioning financial statements and other available financial data. for non-corporate issuers the company analyzes all sources of credit support including issuer-specific factors. the company utilizes information available in the public domain and for certain private placement issuers from consultations with the issuers directly. the company also considers ratings from nationally recognized statistical rating organizations -nrsros as well as the specific characteristics of the security it owns including seniority in the issuer's capital structure covenant protections or other relevant features. from these reviews the company evaluates the issuers' continued ability to service the company's investment through payment of interest and principal.,,,,,,19.0,,,,,,,,,

the company calculates its allowance for credit losses for held-to-maturity fixed maturity securities loan receivables loan commitments and reinsurance recoverable by grouping assets with similar risk characteristics when there is not a specific expectation of a loss for an individual asset. for held-to-maturity fixed maturity securities mmls and mml commitments the company groups assets by credit ratings industry and country. the company groups cmls and tres and respective loan commitments by property type property location and the property’s ltv and debt service coverage ratios. the credit allowance for the reinsurance recoverable balance is estimated using a probability-of-default -pd / loss-given-default -lgd method. the credit allowance for held-to-maturity fixed maturity securities and loan receivables is estimated using a pd / lgd method discounted for the time value of money. for held-to-maturity fixed maturity securities available-for-sale fixed maturity securities and loan receivables the company includes the change in present value due to the passage of time in the change in the allowance for credit losses. the company’s methodology for estimating credit losses utilizes the contractual maturity date of the financial asset adjusted when necessary to reflect the expected timing of repayment -such as prepayment options renewal options call options or extension options. the company applies reasonable and,,,,,,22.0,,,,,,,,,

swaptions are used to mitigate the adverse impact resulting from significant changes in the fair value of u.s. dollar-denominated available-for-sale securities due to fluctuation in interest rates. in a payer swaption the company pays a premium to obtain the right but not the obligation to enter into a swap contract where it will pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate. interest rate swaption collars are combinations of two swaption positions. in order to maximize the efficiency of the collars while minimizing cost a collar strategy is used whereby the company purchases a long payer swaption -the company purchases an option that allows it to enter into a swap where the company will pay the fixed rate and receive the floating rate of the swap and sells a short receiver swaption -the company sells an option that provides the counterparty with the right to enter into a swap where the company will receive the fixed rate and pay the floating rate of the swap. the combination of purchasing the long payer swaption and selling the short receiver swaption results in no net premium being paid -ie. a costless or zero-cost collar. bond purchase commitments result from repackaged bond structures that are consolidated vies whereby there is a delay in the trade date and settlement date of the bond within the structure to ensure completion of all necessary legal agreements to support the consolidated vie that issues the repackaged bond. since the company has a commitment to purchase the underlying bond at a specified price the agreement meets the definition of a derivative where the value is derived based on the current market value of the bond compared to the fixed purchase price to be paid on the settlement date.,,,,,,28.0,,,,,,,,,

interest rate component of the change in fair value the company's investment strategy is to invest primarily in fixed maturity securities to provide a reliable stream of investment income which is one of the drivers of the company’s profitability. this investment strategy incorporates asset-liability matching -alm to align the expected cash flows of the portfolio to the needs of the company's liability structure. the company does not purchase securities with the intent of generating investment gains or losses. however investment gains and losses may be realized as a result of changes in the financial markets and the creditworthiness of specific issuers tax planning strategies and/or general portfolio management and rebalancing. the realization of investment gains and losses is independent of the underwriting and administration of the company's insurance products.,,,,,,73.0,,,,,,,,,
the u.s. insurance industry has a policyholder protection system that provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent insurers. the system can result in periodic charges to the company as a result of insolvencies/bankruptcies that occur with other companies in the life insurance industry. some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. these charges neither relate to the ordinary course of the company’s business nor reflect the company’s underlying business performance but result from external situations not controlled by the company. the company excludes any charges associated with u.s. guaranty fund assessments and the corresponding tax benefit or expense from adjusted earnings. in japan the government also requires the insurance industry to contribute to a policyholder protection corporation that provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent insurers; however these costs are calculated and administered differently than in the u.s.  in japan these costs are not directly related to specific insolvencies or bankruptcies but are rather a regular operational cost for an insurance company. based on this structure the company does not remove the japan policyholder protection expenses from adjusted earnings.,,,,,,74.0,,,,,,,,,

market conditions: the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 -covid-19 global pandemic on the company continues to evolve and the continued path of the global economic recovery remains uncertain given the potential longer term impacts of the pandemic. for example economic conditions have acted as headwinds to sales in the first quarter of 2022 particularly in japan pressuring premium growth rates. further in the u.s. supply shortages upward pressure on wages to attract employees and higher commodity prices have all driven near-term increases in inflation. central bank and government efforts to control inflation as well the impacts of the russia-ukraine conflict including volatility in energy prices and additional disruptions in the global supply chain could lead to slower economic growth in japan and the u.s.  additionally rising energy prices along with increased widening of the differential between u.s. and japan interest rates have contributed to a weakening of the yen which has the effect of suppressing the company's current period results in relation to the comparable prior period.,,,,,,,6.0,,,,,,,,
the company will not early adopt the updated standard and has selected the modified retrospective transition method which requires the amended guidance be applied as of the beginning of the earliest period presented beginning on the january 1 2021 transition date -transition date. the modified retrospective transition method generally results in applying the guidance to contracts on the basis of existing carrying values as of the transition date. on the transition date the company calculates the ratio of expected benefits less existing carrying values to gross premiums -net premium ratio using updated assumptions and the discount rate immediately before the transition date. for any cohorts that have a net premium ratio greater than 100% on the transition date the net premium ratio will be capped at 100%. the company uses the net premium ratio calculated on the transition date -and capped at 100% if required to calculate the lfpb using two different discount rates: i the discount rate used immediately before the transition date and ii the discount rate determined by reference to the transition date market level yields for upper-medium-grade -low credit risk fixed income instruments -as of december 31 2020. for cohorts with their net premium ratio capped at 100% on the transition date any difference between the lfpb calculated using the discount rate immediately before the transition date and the existing carrying value as of the transition date is recorded as an adjustment -decrease to opening retained earnings. for all cohorts on the transition date the difference in the lfpb calculated using the two different discount rates -ie. the discount rate used immediately before the transition date and the updated discount rate as of the transition date is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income -aoci net of tax at transition. when the company adopts the updated standard beginning january 1 2023 opening equity will be adjusted for the transition date impacts to aoci and retained earnings and prior periods presented -years 2021 and 2022 will be restated following the updated standard. based on the modified retrospective transition method the company currently estimates that the transition date impact from adoption is likely to result in a decrease in aoci in a range between $18 billion and $20 billion and a decrease in retained earnings of approximately $0.3 billion. the variability around the impact of adoption,,,,,,,7.0,,,,,,,,

for any significant declines in fair value of its fixed maturity securities the company performs a more focused review of the related issuers' credit profile. for corporate issuers the company evaluates their assets business profile including industry dynamics and competitive positioning financial statements and other available financial data. for non-corporate issuers the company analyzes all sources of credit support including issuer-specific factors. the company utilizes information available in the public domain and for certain private placement issuers from consultations with the issuers directly. the company also considers ratings from nationally recognized statistical rating organizations -nrsros as well as the specific characteristics of the security it owns including seniority in the issuer's capital structure covenant protections or other relevant features. from these reviews the company evaluates the issuers' continued ability to service the company's investment through payment of interest and principal. assuming no credit-related factors develop unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturity securities are expected to diminish as investments near maturity. based on its credit analysis the company believes that the issuers of its fixed maturity investments in the sectors shown in the table above have the ability to service their obligations to the company and the company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases which may be at maturity.,,,,,,,18.0,,,,,,,,

transitional real estate loans tres are commercial mortgage loans that are typically relatively short-term floating rate instruments secured by a first lien on the property. these loans provide funding for properties undergoing a change in their physical characteristics and/or economic profile and do not typically require any principal repayment prior to the maturity date. this loan portfolio is generally considered to be investment grade. as of march 31 2022 the company had $693 million in outstanding commitments to fund tres. these commitments are contingent on the final underwriting and due diligence to be performed.,,,,,,,19.0,,,,,,,,
for mmls and held-to-maturity fixed maturity securities the company’s key credit quality indicator is credit ratings. the company’s held-to-maturity portfolio is composed of investment grade securities that are senior unsecured instruments while its mmls generally have below-investment-grade ratings but are typically senior secured instruments. the company monitors the credit ratings periodically but not less frequently than quarterly. for the company’s reinsurance recoverable balance the key credit quality indicator is the credit rating of the company’s reinsurance counterparty. the company uses external credit ratings focused on the reinsurer’s financial strength and credit worthiness. as of march 31 2022 the company's reinsurance counterparties were rated a+. the company monitors the credit ratings periodically but not less frequently than quarterly.,,,,,,,20.0,,,,,,,,

the company calculates its allowance for credit losses for held-to-maturity fixed maturity securities loan receivables loan commitments and reinsurance recoverable by grouping assets with similar risk characteristics when there is not a specific expectation of a loss for an individual asset. for held-to-maturity fixed maturity securities mmls and mml commitments the company groups assets by credit ratings industry and country. the company groups cmls and tres and respective loan commitments by property type property location and the property’s ltv and debt service coverage ratios. the credit allowance for the reinsurance recoverable balance is estimated using a probability-of-default -pd / loss-given-default -lgd method. the credit allowance for held-to-maturity fixed maturity securities and loan receivables is estimated using a pd / lgd method discounted for the time value of money. for held-to-maturity fixed maturity securities available-for-sale fixed maturity securities and loan receivables the company includes the change in present value due to the passage of time in the change in the allowance for credit losses. the company’s methodology for estimating credit losses utilizes the contractual maturity date of the financial asset adjusted when necessary to reflect the expected timing of repayment -such as prepayment options renewal options call options or extension options. the company applies reasonable and,,,,,,,21.0,,,,,,,,

securities lending and pledged securities the company lends fixed maturity and public equity securities to financial institutions in short-term security-lending transactions. these short-term security-lending arrangements increase investment income with minimal risk. the company receives cash or other securities as collateral for such loans. the company's security lending policy requires that the fair value of the securities received as collateral be 102% or more of the fair value of the loaned securities and that unrestricted cash received as collateral be 100% or more of the fair value of the loaned securities. the securities loaned continue to be carried as investment assets on the company's balance sheet during the terms of the loans and are not reported as sales. for loans involving unrestricted cash or securities as collateral the collateral is reported as an asset with a corresponding liability for the return of the collateral. for loans where the company receives as collateral securities that the company is not permitted to sell or repledge the collateral is not reflected on the consolidated financial statements.,,,,,,,25.0,,,,,,,,

swaptions are used to mitigate the adverse impact resulting from significant changes in the fair value of u.s. dollar-denominated available-for-sale securities due to fluctuation in interest rates. in a payer swaption the company pays a premium to obtain the right but not the obligation to enter into a swap contract where it will pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate. interest rate swaption collars are combinations of two swaption positions. in order to maximize the efficiency of the collars while minimizing cost a collar strategy is used whereby the company purchases a long payer swaption -the company purchases an option that allows it to enter into a swap where the company will pay the fixed rate and receive the floating rate of the swap and sells a short receiver swaption -the company sells an option that provides the counterparty with the right to enter into a swap where the company will receive the fixed rate and pay the floating rate of the swap. the combination of purchasing the long payer swaption and selling the short receiver swaption results in no net premium being paid -ie. a costless or zero-cost collar. bond purchase commitments result from repackaged bond structures that are consolidated vies whereby there is a delay in the trade date and settlement date of the bond within the structure to ensure completion of all necessary legal agreements to support the consolidated vie that issues the repackaged bond. since the company has a commitment to purchase the underlying bond at a specified price the agreement meets the definition of a derivative where the value is derived based on the current market value of the bond compared to the fixed purchase price to be paid on the settlement date.,,,,,,,27.0,,,,,,,,

the company's investment in aflac japan is affected by changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate. to mitigate this exposure the parent company's yen-denominated liabilities -see note 8 have been designated as non-derivative hedges and certain foreign currency forwards and options have been designated as derivative hedges of the foreign currency exposure of the company's net investment in aflac japan. the company's net investment hedge was effective during the three-month periods ended march 31 2022 and 2021 respectively.,,,,,,,29.0,,,,,,,,
the company uses foreign exchange forwards and options to economically mitigate the currency risk of some of its u.s. dollar-denominated loan receivables held within the aflac japan segment. these arrangements are not designated as accounting hedges as the foreign currency remeasurement of the loan receivables impacts current period earnings and substantially offsets gains and losses from foreign exchange forwards within net investment gains -losses. the company also has certain foreign exchange forwards on u.s. dollar-denominated available-for-sale securities where hedge accounting is not being applied. the company uses interest rate swaps to economically convert the variable rate investment income to a fixed rate on certain variable-rate investments.,,,,,,,30.0,,,,,,,,

for the foreign currency swaps associated with the company's vie investments for which it is the primary beneficiary the company bears the risk of loss due to counterparty default even though it is not a direct counterparty to those contracts. the company is a direct counterparty to the foreign currency swaps that it has entered into in connection with certain of its senior notes and subordinated debentures; foreign currency forwards; and foreign currency options and therefore the company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties in those contracts. the risk of counterparty default for the company's foreign currency swaps certain foreign currency forwards and foreign currency options is mitigated by collateral posting requirements that counterparties to those transactions must meet.,,,,,,,31.0,,,,,,,,
the company has securities lending agreements with unaffiliated financial institutions that post collateral to the company in return for the use of its fixed maturity and public equity securities -see note 3. when the company has entered into securities lending agreements with the same counterparty the agreements generally provide for net settlement in the event of default by the counterparty. this right of set-off allows the company to keep and apply collateral received if the counterparty failed to return the securities borrowed from the company as contractually agreed. the tables below summarize the company's derivatives and securities lending transactions and as reflected in the tables in accordance with u.s. gaap the company's policy is to not offset these financial instruments in the consolidated balance sheets.,,,,,,,32.0,,,,,,,,

in february 2022 the company granted 390 thousand performance-based stock awards and units which are contingent on the achievement of the company's financial performance metrics and its market-based conditions. on the date of grant the company estimated the fair value of restricted stock awards and units with market-based conditions using a monte carlo simulation model. the model discounts the value of the stock at the assumed vesting date based on the risk-free interest rate. based on estimates of actual performance versus the vesting thresholds the calculated fair value percentage pay-out estimate will be updated each quarter. the company uses third-party analyses to assist in developing the assumptions used in as well as calibrating a monte carlo simulation model. the company is responsible for determining the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of its share-based payment awards.,,,,,,,60.0,,,,,,,,

the u.s. insurance industry has a policyholder protection system that provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent insurers. the system can result in periodic charges to the company as a result of insolvencies/bankruptcies that occur with other companies in the life insurance industry. some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. these charges neither relate to the ordinary course of the company’s business nor reflect the company’s underlying business performance but result from external situations not controlled by the company. the company excludes any charges associated with u.s. guaranty fund assessments and the corresponding tax benefit or expense from adjusted earnings. in japan the government also requires the insurance industry to contribute to a policyholder protection corporation that provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent insurers; however these costs are calculated and administered differently than in the u.s.  in japan these costs are not directly related to specific insolvencies or bankruptcies but are rather a regular operational cost for an insurance company. based on this structure the company does not remove the japan policyholder protection expenses from adjusted earnings.,,,,,,,69.0,,,,,,,,

the company will not early adopt the updated standard and has selected the modified retrospective transition method.  based upon this transition method the company currently estimates that the january 1 2021 transition date -transition date impact from adoption is likely to result in a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income -aoci in a range between $18 billion and $20 billion. this is due to updating the lfpb discount rate assumptions from the rates locked in for reserves held as of the transition date to rates determined by reference to the transition date market level yields for upper-medium-grade -low credit risk fixed income instruments -as of december 31 2020. the variability around the impact of adoption results from the company making certain estimates primarily related to the determination of transition date market level yields. the company has advanced and continues to refine the design of its discount rate methodology for both the u.s. and japan insurance business. the methodology incorporates constructing a discount rate curve separately for discounting cash flows used to calculate the u.s. and japan lfpb with each curve intended to be reflective of the currency tenor and characteristics of the insurance liabilities. discount rates comprising each curve will be determined by reference to upper-medium grade -low credit risk fixed-income instrument yields that are intended to reflect the duration characteristics of the corresponding insurance liabilities. the company intends to use for these yields single-a rated fixed income instruments with credit ratings based on international rating standards. where only local ratings are available the company intends to select the fixed-income instruments with local ratings that are equivalent to a single-a rating based on international rating standards. the methodology will be designed to prioritize observable inputs based on market data available in the local debt markets where the respective policies were issued in the currency in which the policies are,,,,,,,,10.0,,,,,,,

swaptions are used to mitigate the adverse impact resulting from significant changes in the fair value of u.s. dollar-denominated available-for-sale securities due to fluctuation in interest rates. in a payer swaption the company pays a premium to obtain the right but not the obligation to enter into a swap contract where it will pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate. interest rate swaption collars are combinations of two swaption positions. in order to maximize the efficiency of the collars while minimizing cost a collar strategy is used whereby the company purchases a long payer swaption -the company purchases an option that allows it to enter into a swap where the company will pay the fixed rate and receive the floating rate of the swap and sells a short receiver swaption -the company sells an option that provides the counterparty with the right to enter into a swap where the company will receive the fixed rate and pay the floating rate of the swap. the combination of purchasing the long payer swaption and selling the short receiver swaption results in no net premium being paid -ie. a costless or zero-cost collar. bond purchase commitments result from repackaged bond structures that are consolidated vies whereby there is a delay in the trade date and settlement date of the bond within the structure to ensure completion of all necessary legal agreements to support the consolidated vie that issues the repackaged bond. since the company has a commitment to purchase the underlying bond at a specified price the agreement meets the definition of a derivative where the value is derived based on the current market value of the bond compared to the fixed purchase price to be paid on the settlement date.,,,,,,,,29.0,,,,,,,

the extinguisher feature in most of the company's vie swaps results in a cessation of cash flows and no further payments between the parties to the swap in the event of a default on the referenced or underlying collateral. to price this feature the company applies the survival probability of the referenced entity to the projected cash flows. the survival probability uses the cds spreads and recovery rates to adjust the present value of the cash flows. for extinguisher swaps with positive values an increase in cds spreads decreases the likelihood of receiving the final exchange payments and reduces the value of the swap. for additional information on the company's investments and financial instruments see the accompanying notes 1 3 and 4 and notes 1 3 and 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the 2020 annual report.,,,,,,,,55.0,,,,,,,

in february 2021 the company granted 474 thousand performance-based stock awards which are contingent on the achievement of the company's financial performance metrics and its market-based conditions. on the date of grant the company estimated the fair value of restricted stock awards with market-based conditions using a monte carlo simulation model. the model discounts the value of the stock at the assumed vesting date based on the risk-free interest rate. based on estimates of actual performance versus the vesting thresholds the calculated fair value percentage pay-out estimate will be updated each quarter. the company uses third-party analyses to assist in developing the assumptions used in as well as calibrating a monte carlo simulation model. the company is responsible for determining the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of its share-based payment awards.,,,,,,,,67.0,,,,,,,

transitional real estate loans tres are commercial mortgage loans that are typically relatively short-term floating rate instruments secured by a first lien on the property. these loans provide funding for properties undergoing a change in their physical characteristics and/or economic profile and do not typically require any principal repayment prior to the maturity date. this loan portfolio is generally considered to be investment grade. as of june 30 2021 the company had $1.0 billion in outstanding commitments to fund tres. these commitments are contingent on the final underwriting and due diligence to be performed.,,,,,,,,,18.0,,,,,,

swaptions are used to mitigate the adverse impact resulting from significant changes in the fair value of u.s. dollar-denominated available-for-sale securities due to fluctuation in interest rates. in a payer swaption the company pays a premium to obtain the right but not the obligation to enter into a swap contract where it will pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate. interest rate swaption collars are combinations of two swaption positions. in order to maximize the efficiency of the collars while minimizing cost a collar strategy is used whereby the company purchases a long payer swaption -the company purchases an option that allows it to enter into a swap where the company will pay the fixed rate and receive the floating rate of the swap and sells a short receiver swaption -the company sells an option that provides the counterparty with the right to enter into a swap where the company will receive the fixed rate and pay the floating rate of the swap. the combination of purchasing the long payer swaption and selling the short receiver swaption results in no net premium being paid -ie. a costless or zero-cost collar. bond purchase commitments result from repackaged bond structures that are consolidated vies whereby there is a delay in the trade date and settlement date of the bond within the structure to ensure completion of all necessary legal agreements to support the consolidated vie that issues the repackaged bond. since the company has a commitment to purchase the underlying bond at a specified price the agreement meets the definition of a derivative where the value is derived based on the current market value of the bond compared to the fixed purchase price to be paid on the settlement date.,,,,,,,,,26.0,,,,,,

the extinguisher feature in most of the company's vie swaps results in a cessation of cash flows and no further payments between the parties to the swap in the event of a default on the referenced or underlying collateral. to price this feature the company applies the survival probability of the referenced entity to the projected cash flows. the survival probability uses the cds spreads and recovery rates to adjust the present value of the cash flows. for extinguisher swaps with positive values an increase in cds spreads decreases the likelihood of receiving the final exchange payments and reduces the value of the swap. for additional information on the company's investments and financial instruments see the accompanying notes 1 3 and 4 and notes 1 3 and 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the 2020 annual report.,,,,,,,,,51.0,,,,,,

in february 2021 the company granted 474 thousand performance-based stock awards which are contingent on the achievement of the company's financial performance metrics and its market-based conditions. on the date of grant the company estimated the fair value of restricted stock awards with market-based conditions using a monte carlo simulation model. the model discounts the value of the stock at the assumed vesting date based on the risk-free interest rate. based on estimates of actual performance versus the vesting thresholds the calculated fair value percentage pay-out estimate will be updated each quarter. the company uses third-party analyses to assist in developing the assumptions used in as well as calibrating a monte carlo simulation model. the company is responsible for determining the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of its share-based payment awards.,,,,,,,,,63.0,,,,,,

assuming no credit-related factors develop unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturity securities are expected to diminish as investments near maturity. based on its credit analysis the company believes that the issuers of its fixed maturity investments in the sectors shown in the table above have the ability to service their obligations to the company and the company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases which may be at maturity. however the company has identified certain available-for-sale fixed maturity securities where the amortized cost basis exceeds the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected due to credit related factors and as a result a credit,,,,,,,,,,17.0,,,,,

transitional real estate loans transitional real estate loans are commercial mortgage loans that are typically relatively short-term floating rate instruments secured by a first lien on the property. these loans provide funding for properties undergoing a change in their physical characteristics and/or economic profile and do not typically require any principal repayment prior to the maturity date. this loan portfolio is generally considered to be investment grade. as of march 31 2021 the company had $515 million in outstanding commitments to fund transitional real estate loans. these commitments are contingent on the final underwriting and due diligence to be performed.,,,,,,,,,,18.0,,,,,
for mmls and held-to-maturity fixed maturity securities the company’s key credit quality indicator is credit ratings. the company’s held-to-maturity portfolio is composed of investment grade securities that are senior unsecured instruments while its mmls generally have below-investment-grade ratings but are typically senior secured instruments. the company monitors the credit ratings periodically but not less frequently than quarterly. for the company’s reinsurance recoverable balance the key credit quality indicator is the credit rating of the company’s reinsurance counterparty. the company uses external credit ratings focused on the reinsurer’s financial strength and credit worthiness. the company's counterparties are rated a+. the company monitors the credit ratings periodically but not less frequently than quarterly.,,,,,,,,,,19.0,,,,,

the company calculates its allowance for credit losses for held-to-maturity fixed maturity securities loan receivables loan commitments and reinsurance recoverable by grouping assets with similar risk characteristics when there is not a specific expectation of a loss for an individual asset. for held-to-maturity fixed maturity securities mmls and mml commitments the company groups assets by credit ratings industry and country. the company groups cmls and tres and respective loan commitments by property type property location and the property’s ltv and debt service coverage ratios. the credit allowance for the reinsurance recoverable balance is estimated using a probability-of-default -pd / loss-given-default -lgd method. the credit allowance for held-to-maturity fixed maturity securities and loan receivables is estimated using a pd / lgd method discounted for the time value of money. for held-to-maturity fixed maturity securities available-for-sale fixed maturity securities and loan receivables the company includes the change in present value due to the passage of time in the change in the allowance for credit losses. the company’s methodology for estimating credit losses utilizes the contractual maturity date of the financial asset adjusted when necessary to reflect the expected timing of repayment,,,,,,,,,,20.0,,,,,

from time to time the company may also enter into foreign currency forwards and options to hedge the currency risk associated with the net investment in aflac japan. in these forward transactions aflac agrees with another party to buy a fixed amount of u.s. dollars and sell a corresponding amount of yen at a specified price at a specified future date. in the option transactions the company may use a combination of foreign currency options to protect expected future cash flows by simultaneously purchasing yen put options -options that protect against a weakening yen and selling yen call options -options that limit participation in a strengthening yen. the combination of these two actions create a zero-cost collar. additionally the company enters into purchased options to hedge cash flows from the net investment in aflac japan. the company enters into foreign currency swaps pursuant to which it exchanges an initial principal amount in one currency for an initial principal amount of another currency with an agreement to re-exchange the principal amounts at a future date. there may also be periodic exchanges of payments at specified intervals based on the agreed upon rates and notional amounts. foreign currency swaps are used primarily in the consolidated vies in the company's aflac japan portfolio to convert foreign-denominated cash flows to yen the functional currency of aflac japan in order to minimize,,,,,,,,,,25.0,,,,,

the company uses foreign exchange forwards and options to economically mitigate the currency risk of some of its u.s. dollar-denominated loan receivables held within the aflac japan segment. these arrangements are not designated as accounting hedges as the foreign currency remeasurement of the loan receivables impacts current period earnings and generally offsets gains and losses from foreign exchange forwards within net investment gains -losses. the company also has certain foreign exchange forwards on u.s. dollar-denominated available-for-sale securities where hedge accounting is not being applied. the company uses interest rate swaps to economically convert the variable rate investment income to a fixed rate on certain variable-rate investments.,,,,,,,,,,29.0,,,,,

for the foreign currency and credit default swaps associated with the company's vie investments for which it is the primary beneficiary the company bears the risk of loss due to counterparty default even though it is not a direct counterparty to those contracts. the company is a direct counterparty to the foreign currency swaps that it has entered into in connection with certain of its senior notes and subordinated debentures; foreign currency forwards; and foreign currency options and therefore the company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties in those contracts. the risk of counterparty default for the company's foreign currency swaps certain foreign currency forwards and foreign currency options is mitigated by collateral posting requirements that counterparties to those transactions must meet.,,,,,,,,,,30.0,,,,,
the company has securities lending agreements with unaffiliated financial institutions that post collateral to the company in return for the use of its fixed maturity and public equity securities -see note 3. when the company has entered into securities lending agreements with the same counterparty the agreements generally provide for net settlement in the event of default by the counterparty. this right of set-off allows the company to keep and apply collateral received if the counterparty failed to return the securities borrowed from the company as contractually agreed. the tables below summarize the company's derivatives and securities lending transactions and as reflected in the tables in accordance with u.s. gaap the company's policy is to not offset these financial instruments in the consolidated balance sheets.,,,,,,,,,,31.0,,,,,

the extinguisher feature in most of the company's vie swaps results in a cessation of cash flows and no further payments between the parties to the swap in the event of a default on the referenced or underlying collateral. to price this feature the company applies the survival probability of the referenced entity to the projected cash flows. the survival probability uses the cds spreads and recovery rates to adjust the present value of the cash flows. for extinguisher swaps with positive values an increase in cds spreads decreases the likelihood of receiving the final exchange payments and reduces the value of the swap. for additional information on the company's investments and financial instruments see the accompanying notes 1 3 and 4 and notes 1 3 and 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the 2020 annual report.,,,,,,,,,,48.0,,,,,

in february 2021 the company granted 474 thousand performance-based stock awards which are contingent on the achievement of the company's financial performance metrics and its market-based conditions. on the date of grant the company estimated the fair value of restricted stock awards with market-based conditions using a monte carlo simulation model. the model discounts the value of the stock at the assumed vesting date based on the risk-free interest rate. based on estimates of actual performance versus the vesting thresholds the calculated fair value percentage pay-out estimate will be updated each quarter. the company uses third-party analyses to assist in developing the assumptions used in as well as calibrating a monte carlo simulation model. the company is responsible for determining the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of its share-based payment awards.,,,,,,,,,,57.0,,,,,

swaptions are used to mitigate the adverse impact resulting from significant changes in the fair value of u.s. dollar-denominated available-for-sale securities due to fluctuation in interest rates. in a payer swaption the company pays a premium to obtain the right but not the obligation to enter into a swap contract where it will pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate. interest rate swaption collars are combinations of two swaption positions. in order to maximize the efficiency of the collars while minimizing cost a collar strategy is used whereby the company purchases a long payer swaption -the company purchases an option that allows it to enter into a swap where the company will pay the fixed rate and receive the floating rate of the swap and sells a short receiver swaption -the company sells an option that provides the counterparty with the right to enter into a swap where the company will receive the fixed rate and pay the floating rate of the swap. the combination of purchasing the long payer swaption and selling the short receiver swaption results in no net premium being paid -ie. a costless or zero-cost collar. bond purchase commitments result from repackaged bond structures that are consolidated vies whereby there is a delay in the trade date and settlement date of the bond within the structure to ensure completion of all necessary legal agreements to support the consolidated vie that issues the repackaged bond. since the company has a commitment to purchase the underlying bond at a specified price the agreement meets the definition of a derivative where the value is derived based on the current market value of the bond compared to the fixed purchase price to be paid on the settlement date.,,,,,,,,,,,31.0,,,,

to determine the fair value of its interest rate derivatives the company uses inputs that are generally observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data. interest rate swaps are cleared trades. in a cleared swap contract the clearinghouse provides benefits to the counterparties similar to contracts listed for investment traded on an exchange since it maintains a daily margin to mitigate counterparties' credit risk. these derivatives are priced using observable inputs accordingly they are classified as level 2. for its interest rate swaptions the company estimates their fair values using observable market data including interest rate curves and volatilities. their fair values are also classified as level 2. for derivatives associated with vies where the company is the primary beneficiary the company is not the direct counterparty to the swap contracts. as a result the fair value measurements incorporate the credit risk of the collateral,,,,,,,,,,,49.0,,,,

the extinguisher feature in most of the company's vie swaps results in a cessation of cash flows and no further payments between the parties to the swap in the event of a default on the referenced or underlying collateral. to price this feature the company applies the survival probability of the referenced entity to the projected cash flows. the survival probability uses the cds spreads and recovery rates to adjust the present value of the cash flows. for extinguisher swaps with positive values an increase in cds spreads decreases the likelihood of receiving the final exchange payments and reduces the value of the swap. for additional information on the company's investments and financial instruments see the accompanying notes 1 3 and 4 and notes 1 3 and 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the 2019 annual report.,,,,,,,,,,,55.0,,,,

bond purchase commitments at the inception of investments in consolidated vies some of the company's derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges fair value hedges or net investment hedges; however other derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting or the company elects not to designate them as accounting hedges.,,,,,,,,,,,,28.0,,,
swaptions are used to mitigate the adverse impact resulting from significant changes in the fair value of  u.s. dollar-denominated available-for-sale securities due to fluctuation in interest rates. in a payer swaption the company pays a premium to obtain the right but not the obligation to enter into a swap contract where it will pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate. interest rate swaption collars are combinations of two swaption positions. in order to maximize the efficiency of the collars while minimizing cost a collar strategy is used whereby the company purchases a long payer swaption -the company purchases an option that allows it to enter into a swap where the company will pay the fixed rate and receive the floating rate of the swap and sells a short receiver swaption -the company sells an option that provides the counterparty with the right to enter into a swap where the company will receive the fixed rate and pay the floating rate of the swap. the combination of purchasing the long payer swaption and selling the short receiver swaption results in no net premium being paid -ie. a costless or zero-cost collar. bond purchase commitments result from repackaged bond structures that are consolidated vies whereby there is a delay in the trade date and settlement date of the bond within the structure to ensure completion of all necessary legal agreements to support the consolidated vie that issues the repackaged bond. since the company has a commitment to purchase the underlying bond at a specified price the agreement meets the definition of a derivative where the value is derived based on the current market value of the bond compared to the fixed purchase price to be paid on the settlement date.,,,,,,,,,,,,29.0,,,

the company designates and accounts for certain foreign currency forwards options and interest rate swaptions as fair value hedges when they meet the requirements for hedge accounting. the company recognizes gains and losses on these derivatives as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the related hedged items in current earnings. foreign currency forwards and options hedge the foreign currency exposure of certain u.s. dollar-denominated available-for-sale fixed-maturity investments held in aflac japan. the change in the fair value of the foreign currency forwards related to the changes in the difference between the spot rate and the forward price is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. the change in fair value of the foreign currency option related to the time value of the option is recognized in current earnings and is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.,,,,,,,,,,,,30.0,,,

fair value hierarchy u.s. gaap specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. these two types of inputs create three valuation hierarchy levels. level 1 valuations reflect quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. level 2 valuations reflect quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market quoted market prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets or model-derived valuations in which all significant valuation inputs are observable in active markets. level 3 valuations reflect valuations in which one or more of the significant inputs are not observable in an active market.,,,,,,,,,,,,39.0,,,

for mmls and held-to-maturity fixed maturity securities the company’s key credit quality indicator is credit ratings. the company’s held-to-maturity portfolio is composed of investment grade securities that are senior unsecured instruments while its mmls generally have below-investment-grade ratings but are typically senior secured instruments. the company monitors the credit ratings periodically but not less frequently than quarterly. for the company’s reinsurance recoverable balance the key credit quality indicator is the credit rating of the company’s reinsurance counterparty. the company uses external credit ratings focused on the reinsurer’s financial strength and credit worthiness. the company's counterparties are rated a+. the company monitors the credit ratings periodically but not less frequently than quarterly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,20.0,,

the company calculates its allowance for credit losses for held-to-maturity fixed maturity securities loan receivables loan commitments and reinsurance recoverable by grouping assets with similar risk characteristics when there is not a specific expectation of a loss for an individual asset. for held-to-maturity fixed maturity securities mmls and mml commitments the company groups assets by credit ratings industry and country. the company groups cmls and tres and respective loan commitments by property type property location and the property’s loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios. the credit allowance for the reinsurance recoverable balance is estimated using a probability-of-default -pd / loss-given-default -lgd method. the company’s methodology for estimating credit losses for available-for-sale fixed maturity securities utilizes the discounted cash flow model based on past events current market conditions and future economic conditions as well as industry analysis and credit ratings of the fixed maturity securities. in addition the company evaluates the specific issuer’s probability of default and expected recovery of its position in the event of default based on the underlying financial condition and assets of the borrower as well as seniority and/or security of other debt holders in the issuer when developing management’s best estimate of expected cash flows.,,,,,,,,,,,,,21.0,,

interest rate swaptions used to hedge changes in the fair value associated with interest rate fluctuations for certain u.s. dollar-denominated available-for-sale fixed-maturity securities. some of the company's derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges fair value hedges or net investment hedges; however other derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting or the company elects not to designate them as accounting hedges.,,,,,,,,,,,,,25.0,,
in order to reduce investment income volatility from its variable-rate investments the company enters into receive–fixed pay–floating interest rate swaps. these derivatives are cleared and settled through a central clearinghouse. swaptions are used to mitigate the adverse impact resulting from significant changes in the fair value of  u.s. dollar-denominated available-for-sale securities due to fluctuation in interest rates. in a payer swaption the company pays a premium to obtain the right but not the obligation to enter into a swap contract where it will pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate. interest rate swaption collars are combinations of two swaption positions. in order to maximize the efficiency of the collars while minimizing cost a collar strategy is used whereby the company purchases a long payer swaption -the company purchases an option that allows it to enter into a swap where the company will pay the fixed rate and receive the floating rate of the swap and sells a short receiver swaption -the company sells an option that provides the counterparty with the right to enter into a swap where the company will receive the fixed rate and pay the floating rate of the swap. the combination of purchasing the long payer swaption and selling the short receiver swaption results in no net premium being paid -ie. a costless or zero-cost collar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,26.0,,

the company enters into foreign currency swaps pursuant to which it exchanges an initial principal amount in one currency for an initial principal amount of another currency with an agreement to re-exchange the principal amounts at a future date. there may also be periodic exchanges of payments at specified intervals based on the agreed upon rates and notional amounts. foreign currency swaps are used primarily in the consolidated vies in the company's aflac japan portfolio to convert foreign-denominated cash flows to yen the functional currency of aflac japan in order to minimize cash flow fluctuations. the company also uses foreign currency swaps to economically convert certain of its u.s. dollar-denominated senior note and subordinated debenture principal and interest obligations into yen-denominated obligations. in order to reduce investment income volatility from its variable-rate investments the company enters into receive–fixed pay–floating interest rate swaps. these derivatives are cleared and settled through a central clearinghouse.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,31.0,

interest rate swaptions hedge the interest rate exposure of certain u.s. dollar-denominated available-for-sale securities held in aflac japan. for these hedging relationships the company excludes time value from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes changes in the intrinsic value of the swaptions in current earnings within net investment income. the change in the time value of the swaptions is recognized in other comprehensive income -loss and amortized into earnings -net investment income over its legal term. the following table presents the gains and losses on derivatives and the related hedged items in fair value hedges.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,33.0,

fair value hierarchy u.s. gaap specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. these two types of inputs create three valuation hierarchy levels. level 1 valuations reflect quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. level 2 valuations reflect quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market quoted market prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets or model-derived valuations in which all significant valuation inputs are observable in active markets. level 3 valuations reflect valuations in which one or more of the significant inputs are not observable in an active market.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,42.0,

a third party pricing vendor has developed valuation models to determine fair values of privately issued securities to reflect the impact of the persistent economic environment and the changing regulatory framework. these models are  discounted cash flow -dcf valuation models but also use information from related markets specifically the cds market to estimate expected cash flows. these models take into consideration any unique characteristics of the securities and make various adjustments to arrive at an appropriate issuer-specific loss adjusted credit curve. this credit curve is then used with the relevant recovery rates to estimate expected cash flows and modeling of additional features including illiquidity adjustments if necessary to price the security by discounting those loss adjusted cash flows. in cases where a credit curve cannot be developed from the specific security features the valuation methodology takes into consideration other market observable inputs including: 1 the most appropriate comparable security-ies of the issuer; 2 issuer-specific cds spreads; 3 bonds or cds spreads of comparable issuers with similar characteristics such as rating geography or sector; or 4 bond indices that are comparative in rating industry maturity and region. the pricing data and market quotes the company obtains from outside sources including third party pricing services are reviewed internally for reasonableness. if a fair value appears unreasonable the company will re-examine the inputs and assess the reasonableness of the pricing data with the vendor. additionally the company may compare the inputs to relevant market indices and other performance measurements. based on management's analysis the valuation is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,46.0,

the extinguisher feature in most of the company's vie swaps results in a cessation of cash flows and no further payments between the parties to the swap in the event of a default on the referenced or underlying collateral. to price this feature the company applies the survival probability of the referenced entity to the projected cash flows. the survival probability uses the cds spreads and recovery rates to adjust the present value of the cash flows. for extinguisher swaps with positive values an increase in cds spreads decreases the likelihood of receiving the final exchange payments and reduces the value of the swap. for additional information on the company's investments and financial instruments see the accompanying notes 1 3 and 4 and notes 1 3 and 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2018.0,

the following discussion includes references to the company's performance measures adjusted earnings adjusted earnings per diluted share and amortized hedge costs/income which are not calculated in accordance with u.s. gaap. these measures exclude items that the company believes may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in the company's insurance operations because they tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events or related to infrequent activities not directly associated with its insurance operations. the company's management uses adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per diluted share to evaluate the financial performance of its insurance operations on a consolidated basis and the company believes that a presentation of these measures is vitally important to an understanding of its underlying profitability drivers and trends of its insurance business. the company believes that amortized hedge costs/income which are a component of adjusted earnings measure the periodic currency risk management costs/income related to hedging certain foreign currency exchange risks and are an important component of net investment income. the company defines adjusted earnings -a non-u.s. gaap financial measure as the profits derived from operations. the most comparative u.s. gaap measure is net earnings. adjusted earnings are adjusted revenues less benefits and adjusted expenses. the adjustments to both revenues and expenses account for certain items that cannot be predicted or that are outside management’s control. adjusted revenues are u.s. gaap total revenues excluding realized investment gains and losses except for amortized hedge costs/income related to foreign currency exposure management strategies and net interest cash flows from derivatives associated with certain investment strategies. adjusted expenses are u.s. gaap total acquisition and operating expenses including the impact of interest cash flows from derivatives associated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,73.0,
because a significant portion of the company's business is conducted in japan and foreign exchange rates are outside of management’s control the company believes it is important to understand the impact of translating japanese yen into u.s. dollars. adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per diluted share excluding current period foreign currency impact are computed using the average yen/dollar exchange rate for the comparable prior year period which eliminates fluctuations driven solely by yen-to-dollar currency rate changes. the following table is a reconciliation of items impacting adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per diluted share to the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measures of net earnings and net earnings per diluted share respectively.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,74.0,

realized investment gains and losses the company's investment strategy is to invest primarily in fixed maturity securities to provide a reliable stream of investment income which is one of the drivers of the company’s growth and profitability. this investment strategy incorporates asset-liability matching -alm to align the expected cash flows of the portfolio to the needs of the company's liability structure. the company does not purchase securities with the intent of generating capital gains or losses. however investment gains and losses may be realized as a result of changes in the financial markets and the creditworthiness of specific issuers tax planning strategies and/or general portfolio management and rebalancing. the realization of investment gains and losses is independent of the underwriting and administration of the company's insurance products. realized investment gains and losses include securities transactions impairments changes in loan loss reserves derivative and foreign currency activities and changes in fair value of equity securities.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,75.0,

in 2018 the company announced a change in its internal dividend policy which allows the company to increase the proportion of regulatory earnings transferred from aflac u.s. and aflac japan to the parent company. the company intends to maintain higher than historical levels of capital and liquidity at the parent company with the goals of addressing the company’s hedge costs and related potential need for collateral and mitigating against long-term weakening of the japanese yen. further the company plans to continue to maintain a portfolio of unhedged u.s. dollar based investments at aflac japan and consider whether the amount of such investments should be increased or decreased relative to the company’s view of economic equity surplus in aflac japan in light of potentially rising hedge costs and other factors. see item 2. management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under “forward-looking information” for a description of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the company in regards to its capital management intentions. the parent company accesses debt security markets to provide additional sources of capital. in september 2018 the parent company filed a shelf registration statement with the sec that allows the company to issue an indefinite amount of debt securities in one or more series from time to time until september 2021. in august 2018 the parent company filed a shelf registration with japanese regulatory authorities that allows the parent company to conduct public offerings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,96.0,

regulatory restrictions aflac and caic are domiciled in nebraska and are subject to its regulations. subsequent to the japan branch conversion to a subsidiary aflac japan is domiciled in japan and subject to local regulations. see further discussion below. a life insurance company’s statutory capital and surplus is determined according to rules prescribed by the national association of insurance commissioners -naic as modified by the insurance department in the insurance company’s state of domicile. statutory accounting rules are different from u.s. gaap and are intended to emphasize policyholder protection and company solvency. similar laws apply in new york the domiciliary jurisdiction of aflac's new york insurance subsidiary.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,99.0,
in addition to limitations and restrictions imposed by u.s. insurance regulators after the japan branch conversion on april 1 2018 the new japan subsidiary is required to meet certain financial criteria as governed by japanese corporate law in order to provide dividends to the parent company. under these criteria dividend capacity at the japan subsidiary is basically defined as total equity excluding common stock accumulated other comprehensive income amounts capital reserves -representing statutorily required amounts in japan but reduced for net after-tax unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities.  these dividend capacity requirements are generally aligned with the solvency margin ratio -smr. japan's financial services agency -fsa maintains its own solvency standard which is quantified through the smr. aflac japan's smr is sensitive to interest rate credit spread and foreign exchange rate changes therefore the company continues to evaluate alternatives for reducing this sensitivity. in the event of a rapid change in market risk conditions causing smr to decline the company has two senior unsecured revolving credit facilities in the amounts of ¥100 billion  and ¥55 billion respectively and a committed reinsurance facility in the amount of approximately ¥110 billion as a capital contingency plan. additionally the company could take action to enter into derivatives on unhedged u.s. dollar-denominated investments with foreign currency options or forwards. -see notes 7 and 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. the company has already undertaken various measures to mitigate the sensitivity of aflac japan's smr. for example the company employs policy reserve matching -prm investment strategies which is a japan-specific accounting treatment that reduces smr interest rate sensitivity since prm-designated investments are carried at amortized cost consistent with corresponding liabilities. in order for a prm-designated asset to be held at amortized cost there are certain criteria that must be maintained. the primary criteria relates to maintaining the duration of designated assets and liabilities within a specified tolerance range. if the duration difference is not maintained within the specified range without rebalancing then a certain portion of the assets must be re-classified as available for sale and held at fair value with any associated unrealized gain or loss recorded in surplus. to rebalance assets may need to be sold in order to maintain the duration with the specified range resulting in realizing a gain or loss from the sale. for u.s. gaap prm investments are categorized as available for sale. the company also uses foreign currency derivatives to hedge a portion of its u.s. dollar-denominated investments. -see notes 3 4 and 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2018.0,
 aflac japan's smr remains high and reflects a strong capital and surplus position. as part of the conversion of aflac japan from a branch to a subsidiary on april 1 2018 the company experienced an accounting-driven decline in the smr of approximately 130 points based on the smr as of december 31 2017. the company expects to be able to pay dividends out of certain accounts thus restoring this accounting impact over an estimated three-year period. payments are made from aflac japan to the parent company for management fees allocated expenses and remittances of earnings. prior to the aflac japan branch conversion on april 1 2018 aflac japan paid allocated expenses,,,,,,,,,,,,,,100.0,

fair value hierarchy u.s. gaap specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. these two types of inputs create three valuation hierarchy levels. level 1 valuations reflect quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. level 2 valuations reflect quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market quoted market prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets or model-derived valuations in which all significant valuation inputs are observable in active markets. level 3 valuations reflect valuations in which one or more of the significant inputs are not observable in an active market.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,37.0

a third party pricing vendor has developed valuation models to determine fair values of privately issued securities to reflect the impact of the persistent economic environment and the changing regulatory framework. these models are  discounted cash flow -dcf valuation models but also use information from related markets specifically the cds market to estimate expected cash flows. these models take into consideration any unique characteristics of the securities and make various adjustments to arrive at an appropriate issuer-specific loss adjusted credit curve. this credit curve is then used with the relevant recovery rates to estimate expected cash flows and modeling of additional features including illiquidity adjustments if necessary to price the security by discounting those loss adjusted cash flows. in cases where a credit curve cannot be developed from the specific security features the valuation methodology takes into consideration other market observable inputs including: 1 the most appropriate comparable security-ies of the issuer; 2 issuer-specific cds spreads; 3 bonds or cds spreads of comparable issuers with similar characteristics such as rating geography or sector; or 4 bond indices that are comparative in rating industry maturity and region. the pricing data and market quotes the company obtains from outside sources including third party pricing services are reviewed internally for reasonableness. if a fair value appears unreasonable the company will re-examine the inputs and assess the reasonableness of the pricing data with the vendor. additionally the company may compare the inputs to relevant market indices and other performance measurements. based on management's analysis the valuation is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,41.0

the extinguisher feature in most of the company's vie swaps results in a cessation of cash flows and no further payments between the parties to the swap in the event of a default on the referenced or underlying collateral. to price this feature the company applies the survival probability of the referenced entity to the projected cash flows. the survival probability uses the cds spreads and recovery rates to adjust the present value of the cash flows. for extinguisher swaps with positive values an increase in cds spreads decreases the likelihood of receiving the final exchange payments and reduces the value of the swap. for additional information on the company's investments and financial instruments see the accompanying notes 1 3 and 4 and notes 1 3 and 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2018.0

the following discussion includes references to the company's performance measures adjusted earnings adjusted earnings per diluted share and amortized hedge costs/income which are not calculated in accordance with u.s. gaap. these measures exclude items that the company believes may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in the company's insurance operations because they tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events or related to infrequent activities not directly associated with its insurance operations. the company's management uses adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per diluted share to evaluate the financial performance of its insurance operations on a consolidated basis and the company believes that a presentation of these measures is vitally important to an understanding of its underlying profitability drivers and trends of its insurance business. the company believes that amortized hedge costs/income which are a component of adjusted earnings measure the periodic currency risk management costs/income related to hedging certain foreign currency exchange risks and are an important component of net investment income. the company defines adjusted earnings -a non-u.s. gaap financial measure as the profits derived from operations. the most comparative u.s. gaap measure is net earnings. adjusted earnings are adjusted revenues less benefits and adjusted expenses. the adjustments to both revenues and expenses account for certain items that cannot be predicted or that are outside management’s control. adjusted revenues are u.s. gaap total revenues excluding realized investment gains and losses except for amortized hedge costs/income related to foreign currency exposure management strategies and net interest cash flows from derivatives associated with certain investment strategies. adjusted expenses are u.s. gaap total acquisition and operating expenses including the impact of interest cash flows from derivatives associated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,68.0

in addition to limitations and restrictions imposed by u.s. insurance regulators after the japan branch conversion on april 1 2018 the new japan subsidiary is required to meet certain financial criteria as governed by japanese corporate law in order to provide dividends to the parent company. under these criteria dividend capacity at the japan subsidiary is basically defined as total equity excluding common stock accumulated other comprehensive income amounts capital reserves -representing statutorily required amounts in japan but reduced for net after-tax unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities.  these dividend capacity requirements are generally aligned with the solvency margin ratio -smr. japan's financial services agency -fsa maintains its own solvency standard which is quantified through the smr. aflac japan's smr is sensitive to interest rate credit spread and foreign exchange rate changes therefore the company continues to evaluate alternatives for reducing this sensitivity. in the event of a rapid change in market risk conditions causing smr to decline the company has two senior unsecured revolving credit facilities in the amounts of 100 billion yen and 55 billion yen respectively and a committed reinsurance facility in the amount of approximately 110 billion yen as a capital contingency plan. additionally the company could take action to enter into derivatives on unhedged u.s. dollar-denominated investments with foreign currency options or forwards. -see notes 7 and 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. the company has already undertaken various measures to mitigate the sensitivity of aflac japan's smr. for example the company employs policy reserve matching -prm investment strategies which is a japan-specific accounting treatment that reduces smr interest rate sensitivity since prm-designated investments are carried at amortized cost consistent with corresponding liabilities. in order for a prm-designated asset to be held at amortized cost there are certain criteria that must be maintained. the primary criteria relates to maintaining the duration of designated assets and liabilities within a specified tolerance range. if the duration difference is not maintained within the specified range without rebalancing then a certain portion of the assets must be re-classified as available for sale and held at fair value with any associated unrealized gain or loss recorded in surplus. to rebalance assets may need to be sold in order to maintain the duration with the specified range resulting in realizing a gain or loss from the sale. for u.s. gaap prm investments are categorized as available for sale. the company also uses foreign currency derivatives to hedge a portion of its u.s. dollar-denominated investments. -see notes 3 4 and 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2018.0
